          <p><strong>Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI</strong></p>

          <h4>What – Context and focus</h4>
          <p>
            Since late 2022, generative AI (GenAI) tools have rapidly transitioned from research settings into everyday use.
            They now generate code, text, images and summaries at scale. As Correa et al. (2023) highlight, this expansion
            has been accompanied by the publication of more than 200 AI ethics guidelines worldwide, differing widely in
            scope, terminology and enforceability. Deckard (2023) further argues that organisations face strong pressure
            to adopt GenAI quickly, often before governance frameworks are fully developed.
          </p>

          <p>
            For computing professionals, this raises a critical question: how can GenAI be used responsibly when global
            ethical norms are fragmented and legal frameworks are still evolving? In this reflection, I draw on academic
            literature and professional codes (ACM, BCS) and connect these discussions to my background in biomedical
            engineering and my interest in AI for healthcare.
          </p>

          <h4>So what – Analysis and position</h4>

          <h5>Fragmented principles and enforceability</h5>
          <p>
            Many AI ethics frameworks emphasise shared values such as fairness, transparency and accountability, but often
            lack mechanisms for enforcement. I see a risk that ethics becomes performative rather than operational. A
            layered approach is required, where regulation, professional standards and organisational controls reinforce
            each other.
          </p>

          <h5>Risk-tiered governance</h5>
          <p>
            GenAI applications vary widely in risk. Low-risk uses may require minimal safeguards, while high-risk systems,
            particularly in healthcare, demand rigorous testing, human oversight and accountability mechanisms.
          </p>

          <h5>Data governance and professional competence</h5>
          <p>
            Ethical GenAI begins with responsible data practices. In healthcare contexts, misuse of physiological or
            mental-health data can cause direct harm. Professionals must also remain competent users of GenAI, recognising
            limitations such as hallucinations and bias, and clearly disclosing AI assistance.
          </p>

          <h4>Now what – Action</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Adopt risk-based governance frameworks for GenAI.</li>
            <li>Embed professional codes into organisational AI policies.</li>
            <li>Strengthen training on AI ethics, law and human-centred design.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This activity shifted my perspective from enthusiasm toward responsibility. As I progress in AI and healthcare,
            I aim to prioritise patient wellbeing, data protection and ethical accountability alongside technical innovation.

        <div class="card" id="activity2">

            <h2>Reflective Activity 2: Case Study – Inappropriate Use of Surveys</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 5 · Cambridge Analytica and survey misuse</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated how surveys can be ethically misused when transparency and consent
            are absent. Data collected under the guise of entertainment was repurposed for political profiling without
            meaningful participant awareness.
          </p>

          <p>
            This case raised ethical, legal, social and professional concerns, including violations of privacy, erosion of
            trust and misuse of data-driven influence. It directly contradicts professional principles emphasising honesty,
            consent and harm prevention.
          </p>

          <p>
            For my future work in AI and healthcare, this reinforces the responsibility to design data collection tools
            transparently, minimise data capture and ensure participants understand how their data will be used and protected.

            <h2 class="page-title">Unit 11 – Going Forward: Professional Development</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Learning loop, skills matrix and action planning</div>
          </div>

          <h4>What – Reviewing my learning journey</h4>
          <p>
            Unit 11 focused on reviewing my learning approach and professional development using my e-Portfolio as
            a reflective tool. By revisiting artefacts across the module, I was able to identify how earlier learning
            informed later work and how my understanding evolved over time.
          </p>

          <h4>So what – Skills awareness and reflection</h4>
          <p>
            Completing the Professional Skills Matrix helped me identify strengths in analytical reasoning, ethical
            awareness and the application of AI concepts to healthcare contexts. It also highlighted areas for
            continued development, particularly advanced statistical modelling and industry-aligned certification.
          </p>

          <p>
            The SWOT analysis provided a balanced evaluation of my current position, while the action plan translated
            reflection into concrete steps for continuous professional development.
          </p>

          <h4>Now what – Forward planning</h4>
          <p>
            The learning loop reinforced that professional growth is iterative. Insights from this module will guide
            my MSc project and future CPD activities, ensuring that technical competence is matched by ethical
            responsibility and reflective practice.
