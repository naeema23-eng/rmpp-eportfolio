            </div>

          <p>
            Reflective Activity 1 asked me to engage critically with the ethical challenges posed by
            <strong>generative AI</strong> and to relate these to professional codes such as the ACM and BCS.
            Drawing on academic literature and my own background in biomedical engineering and AI, I examined how
            fragmented global AI guidelines, data governance issues and human-centred design all shape responsible
            GenAI use.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the reflection, I argued for a <strong>risk-tiered, enforceable governance framework</strong> that
            combines global principles, local law, professional codes and concrete engineering practices. I emphasised
            that ethical practice for computing professionals now includes understanding GenAI limitations, handling
            sensitive health data responsibly, and designing systems around human physiological and cognitive limits.
          </p>

          <p>
            This activity established a foundation for the rest of the module: it connected research methods with
            real-world ethical decision-making, especially in AI-enabled healthcare contexts. The full text of this
            reflection is presented on the <strong>Reflections</strong> page.
