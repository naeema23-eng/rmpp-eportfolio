          <p><strong>Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI</strong></p>

          <h4>What – Context and focus</h4>
          <p>
            Since late 2022, generative AI (GenAI) tools have rapidly transitioned from research settings into everyday use.
            They now generate code, text, images and summaries at scale. As Correa et al. (2023) highlight, this expansion
            has been accompanied by the publication of more than 200 AI ethics guidelines worldwide, differing widely in
            scope, terminology and enforceability.
          </p>

          <h4>So what – Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This fragmentation highlighted the risk of ethics becoming symbolic rather than operational. Professional
            codes such as the ACM and BCS frameworks emphasise public interest, accountability and competence, which helped
            me contextualise ethical responsibility beyond technical accuracy.
          </p>

          <h4>Now what – Action</h4>
          <p>
            This reflection reshaped my understanding of responsible AI practice, especially in healthcare contexts where
            misuse of data or automation bias can cause direct harm.

          </div>

          <p>
            The Cambridge Analytica case illustrated how unethical survey design and lack of transparency can undermine
            trust, violate privacy and cause societal harm.

          <h4>What – Overview of learning across the module</h4>
          <p>
            This module provided a structured foundation in research methods, ethics, statistics and professional practice
            within computing. At the beginning of the module, my understanding of research was largely technical and
            outcome-focused. Through progressive engagement with discussions, research planning activities, statistical
            exercises and reflective tasks, I developed a more critical and holistic view of how computing research must
            balance methodological rigour, ethical responsibility and real-world feasibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Key artefacts such as the literature review, research proposal, statistical worksheets and reflective
            activities formed a coherent learning narrative. Rather than isolated tasks, each unit built on previous
            learning, culminating in an integrated understanding of academic investigation and professional conduct.
          </p>

          <h4>So what – Critical reflection and analysis</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most significant learning shifts occurred in relation to research design. Early planning activities
            revealed my tendency to define broad, descriptive topics. Peer review exercises and proposal feedback
            demonstrated that strong research must align research questions, data availability, methodology and ethical
            constraints. This insight directly influenced how I refined my proposal scope and justified methodological
            decisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Statistical learning in Units 6–9 challenged my assumptions about data interpretation. I learned that
            correctness of calculation is insufficient without careful consideration of validity, reliability and
            presentation. The American Statistical Association’s ethical guidelines reinforced that misleading
            visualisation or selective reporting can be as harmful as computational errors (American Statistical
            Association, 2022).
          </p>

          <p>
            Ethical discussions were particularly impactful given my interest in AI for healthcare. The ACM (2018) and BCS
            (2021) codes of conduct helped me frame ethics as an ongoing professional obligation rather than a compliance
            checklist. This perspective was reinforced by case studies involving data misuse, automation bias and survey
            manipulation, which highlighted the societal consequences of irresponsible computing practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reflecting using Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper’s (2001) framework enabled deeper self-analysis. I recognised how
            my initial confidence sometimes masked gaps in methodological reasoning, and how structured reflection
            supported more deliberate learning and professional growth.
          </p>

          <h4>Now what – Application and future development</h4>
          <p>
            The learning from this module will directly inform my MSc project and professional practice. Methodologically,
            I will prioritise feasibility, transparency and justification in research design. Statistically, I will ensure
            that analysis and visualisation choices communicate uncertainty honestly and ethically. Professionally, I will
            continue to align my work with established ethical standards and reflect critically on the broader impact of
            AI systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The professional skills matrix and action plan developed in Unit 11 provide a practical roadmap for continuous
            development, including strengthening advanced statistical skills and pursuing relevant certifications. Most
            importantly, this module reinforced that responsible computing requires reflection, humility and accountability
            alongside technical expertise.
