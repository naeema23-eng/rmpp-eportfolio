          <p><strong>Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI</strong></p>

          <h4>What – Context and focus</h4>
          <p>
            Since late 2022, generative AI (GenAI) tools have rapidly transitioned from research settings into everyday use.
            They now generate code, text, images and summaries at scale. As Correa et al. (2023) highlight, this expansion
            has been accompanied by the publication of more than 200 AI ethics guidelines worldwide, differing widely in
            scope, terminology and enforceability.
          </p>

          <h4>So what – Analysis</h4>
          <p>
            This fragmentation highlighted the risk of ethics becoming symbolic rather than operational. Professional
            codes such as the ACM and BCS frameworks emphasise public interest, accountability and competence, which helped
            me contextualise ethical responsibility beyond technical accuracy.
          </p>

          <h4>Now what – Action</h4>
          <p>
            This reflection reshaped my understanding of responsible AI practice, especially in healthcare contexts where
            misuse of data or automation bias can cause direct harm.

          <h4>What – Overview of learning across the module</h4>
          <p>
            This module provided a structured foundation in research methods, ethics, statistics and professional practice
            within computing. At the beginning of the module, my understanding of research was largely technical and
            outcome-focused. I associated research quality mainly with producing results, implementing models, or
            completing tasks correctly. Through progressive engagement with collaborative discussions, research planning
            activities, statistical exercises and reflective tasks, I developed a more critical and holistic view of how
            computing research must balance methodological rigour, ethical responsibility and real-world feasibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            Key artefacts such as the literature review, research proposal, statistical worksheets and reflective
            activities formed a coherent learning narrative rather than isolated tasks. Early units introduced ethical and
            professional expectations, which then shaped how I approached later work in data analysis and research
            design. As the module progressed, I began to recognise that research is not a linear process but an iterative
            one, where assumptions are challenged, methods refined, and decisions justified in response to evidence and
            constraints.
          </p>

          <p>
            The structure of the module also encouraged cumulative learning. Insights gained from peer discussion and
            feedback informed later proposal development, while statistical concepts introduced in Units 6–9 influenced
            how I interpreted data and presented results. By Unit 12, I had developed a clearer understanding of how
            academic investigation, professional standards and reflective practice intersect within responsible
            computing research.
          </p>

          <h4>So what – Critical reflection and analysis</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most significant learning shifts occurred in relation to research design. During the early planning
            stages, particularly in Units 2–4, I found myself gravitating toward broad and descriptive topics driven by
            personal interest rather than research feasibility. Although I felt confident about the subject area, peer
            review exercises and the Unit 3 proposal review revealed weaknesses in my approach, including vague research
            questions, limited consideration of data access, and insufficient methodological justification. This was
            initially uncomfortable, as it challenged my assumption that enthusiasm and technical interest were
            sufficient foundations for a strong proposal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Engaging with peer feedback forced me to confront the gap between an interesting idea and a viable research
            project. I began to understand that strong research design requires explicit alignment between the research
            question, available data, analytical methods and ethical constraints. This insight significantly influenced
            how I refined my proposal scope, moving from an ambitious but unrealistic plan toward a focused, justifiable
            and ethically grounded study.
          </p>

          <p>
            Statistical learning in Units 6–9 was another area that challenged my existing assumptions. Prior to this
            module, I viewed statistics primarily as a technical skill involving correct calculation. Completing the
            descriptive and inferential statistics worksheets highlighted how easily results can be misunderstood or
            misrepresented if underlying assumptions are ignored. I found hypothesis testing particularly challenging,
            not because of the calculations themselves, but because of the responsibility involved in interpreting
            results correctly and acknowledging uncertainty.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ethical dimension of statistical practice became especially clear through discussion of validity,
            reliability and data visualisation. The American Statistical Association’s ethical guidelines reinforced that
            misleading presentation or selective reporting can cause real harm, even when calculations are technically
            correct (American Statistical Association, 2022). This shifted my perspective from “getting the right answer”
            to communicating results honestly, transparently and responsibly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ethical discussions throughout the module were particularly impactful given my interest in AI for healthcare.
            Engaging with the ACM (2018) and BCS (2021) codes of conduct helped me frame ethics as an ongoing professional
            responsibility rather than a checklist for compliance. Case studies involving data misuse, automation bias
            and survey manipulation illustrated how unethical computing practices can undermine public trust and cause
            long-term societal harm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using Rolfe, Freshwater and Jasper’s (2001) reflective framework supported deeper self-analysis. Through
            structured reflection, I recognised how my initial confidence sometimes masked gaps in methodological
            reasoning and ethical awareness. Reflection allowed me to slow down, question my assumptions and engage more
            deliberately with feedback. This process strengthened not only my academic work but also my professional
            self-awareness.
          </p>

          <!-- ✅ META-REFLECTION SENTENCE (ADDED) -->
          <p>
            Previously, I viewed research quality primarily as the technical correctness of methods and results; whereas I now conceptualise it as a balance between methodological rigour, ethical responsibility, feasibility, and the real-world consequences of how findings are interpreted and used.
          </p>

          <h4>Now what – Application and future development</h4>
          <p>
            The learning from this module will directly inform my MSc project and professional practice. Methodologically,
            I will prioritise feasibility, clarity and justification when designing research studies, ensuring that
            research questions are realistic and supported by appropriate data and methods. I now recognise the
            importance of documenting assumptions, limitations and ethical considerations explicitly rather than
            treating them as secondary concerns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Statistically, I will apply a more cautious and reflective approach to data analysis. This includes selecting
            analytical techniques that align with the research question, communicating uncertainty clearly, and avoiding
            over-interpretation of results. I will also be more critical of how visualisations can influence
            interpretation, ensuring that presentation choices support transparency rather than persuasion.
          </p>

          <p>
            From a professional perspective, this module reinforced the importance of aligning computing practice with
            established ethical standards. I intend to continue using the ACM and BCS codes as practical guides for
            decision-making rather than abstract principles. The Professional Skills Matrix and action plan developed in
            Unit 11 provide a concrete framework for ongoing development, including strengthening advanced statistical
            skills, improving academic writing, and pursuing relevant certifications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, this module reshaped how I view my identity as a computing professional. It highlighted
            that responsible computing requires reflection, humility and accountability alongside technical competence.
            As I move forward into my MSc project and future roles in AI-enabled healthcare, I aim to apply these lessons
            to ensure that my work contributes positively, ethically and responsibly to both the discipline and society.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, this module has increased my confidence in engaging critically with academic literature and
            professional guidance rather than accepting them at face value. I now feel better equipped to question
            assumptions, justify decisions, and articulate the reasoning behind my choices to both technical and
            non-technical audiences. This confidence will be essential as I progress into more independent research and
            professional roles.
