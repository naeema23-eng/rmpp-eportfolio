          <p>
            My name is <strong>Naeema Abdalla Ahmed Alnaqbi</strong>, a biomedical engineer working in the UAE with a strong and
            growing interest in applying <strong>Artificial Intelligence responsibly within healthcare environments</strong>.
            Through my work in emergency medical services and medical device management, I have developed an appreciation for
            how research, evidence and professional ethics shape safe and effective healthcare practice.
          </p>

          <p>
            I joined the <strong>MSc Artificial Intelligence</strong> to build the analytical and scientific foundations
            necessary to integrate AI with biomedical engineering. The module
            <strong>Research Methods and Professional Practice</strong> plays a central role in this development because it
            teaches not only <em>how</em> to conduct research, but also <em>how</em> to do so ethically, rigorously and with
            professional accountability.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout this module, I have strengthened my understanding of research design, ethical decision-making,
            academic communication, data integrity and professional codes of conduct. These competencies are essential for
            my long-term goal of contributing to AI-enabled healthcare systems that emphasise patient safety, fairness,
            transparency and trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            This e-portfolio documents my learning journey across all module activities, including
            collaborative discussions, research planning, literature review development, statistics worksheets and
            structured reflection. Each component demonstrates how this module has shaped my professional identity and
            enhanced my confidence as a researcher and AI practitioner.
