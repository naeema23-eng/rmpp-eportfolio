          <p>
            My name is <strong>Naeema Abdalla Ahmed Alnaqbi</strong>. I am a biomedical engineer working in emergency and
            ambulance services, and I am currently completing my <strong>MSc Artificial Intelligence</strong> at the
            University of Essex Online.
          </p>

          <p>
            My core interest is integrating AI into healthcare in ways that improve patient safety, support clinicians, and
            respect ethical, legal and professional standards. The <strong>Research Methods and Professional Practice</strong>
            module helps me strengthen the academic skills needed to design, evaluate and communicate research responsibly.

            This e-portfolio supports my long-term goals of working in AI-enhanced healthcare systems. As the module
            progresses, additional research tasks, statistical work, and structured reflections will be added in their
            allocated sections.
