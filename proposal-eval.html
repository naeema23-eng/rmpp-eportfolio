    <h3>Literature Review &amp; Research Proposal Evaluation (Approx. 350 words)</h3>

    <p>
      This section evaluates the development of my Literature Review and Research Proposal across the module, focusing on how my understanding of research design, methodology, feasibility and ethics evolved through iterative learning and feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the early stages of the module (Units 2–4), my primary challenge was refining a broad professional interest into a researchable academic problem. Initially, my focus on AI in healthcare was wide and descriptive. Through structured planning activities and the Unit 3 proposal review exercise, I learned that a strong proposal must demonstrate clear alignment between the research question, chosen methodology, and available data. Reviewing peer proposals helped me recognise weaknesses such as overly ambitious scope, insufficient methodological justification, and lack of feasibility analysis. This directly influenced my own planning by encouraging tighter scoping and clearer justification of design choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Literature Review Outline developed in Unit 4 marked a shift from summarising studies to synthesising themes. Rather than listing papers, I organised the literature around limitations of static early warning scores, advantages of time-series physiological modelling, and challenges of real-world deployment. This thematic approach strengthened the academic argument and clarified how my proposed research could contribute to the field. It also highlighted ethical and practical constraints, particularly around access to prehospital clinical data, which informed later methodological decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      By Units 8–10, my proposal development became more methodologically grounded. Learning about statistical validity, data interpretation and ethical presentation of results influenced how I framed model evaluation and limitations in the Research Proposal Presentation. Feedback on the proposal highlighted strengths in clarity and logical structure, particularly in articulating why machine-learning approaches may outperform rule-based systems in dynamic ambulance environments. It also identified areas for improvement, including greater emphasis on human factors and clearer explanation of the analytical pipeline, which I have noted for future work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this process transformed my approach from exploratory planning to evidence-based proposal construction. The experience strengthened my ability to justify methodological choices, assess feasibility realistically, and integrate ethical responsibility into research design—skills that will be essential for my MSc project and professional practice.
