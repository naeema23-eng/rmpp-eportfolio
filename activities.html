          </div>

          <p>
            In Unit 1, I engaged in Collaborative Learning Discussion 1, which helped me connect the module’s
            expectations to real-world practice. I focused on how research quality, evidence, and professional
            responsibility link directly to computing work in healthcare.
          </p>

          <h3>What I did</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Posted an initial contribution grounded in academic reading and professional context.</li>
            <li>Responded to peers by comparing viewpoints and clarifying assumptions.</li>
            <li>Completed a short summary post reflecting on the main themes and what I learned.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This activity strengthened my ability to write academically, reference evidence appropriately,
            and engage professionally in debate. It also reinforced the importance of ethical awareness and
            responsibility when research outcomes may influence clinical decisions.

            <div class="meta small-muted">Key activity: Planning the Literature Review &amp; Proposal Outline</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            In Unit 2, I completed the planning activity for my Literature Review and Research Proposal Outlines.
            I refined my topic area (AI in healthcare, with a focus on prediction and decision support) and began
            shaping a feasible, academically grounded research direction.
          </p>

          <h3>What I produced</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A draft research focus and early research question framing.</li>
            <li>A preliminary structure for the literature review (themes and keywords).</li>
            <li>An outline plan for a research proposal aligned with ethical and data-access constraints.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This activity helped me move from a broad interest to a researchable topic. It also clarified how the
            research question drives method selection, data needs, and ethical approval requirements.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- UNIT 3 -->
        <div class="card" id="seminar2">
          <div class="card-header">
            <h2 class="page-title">Seminar 2: Peer Review Activity</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 3 · Evaluating literature, research design and methods</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            In this seminar, I reviewed two research papers in the broad area of AI in healthcare
            that used different research methods. One paper applied a quantitative machine-learning
            approach to predict patient deterioration using physiological time-series data, while the
            second paper used a qualitative, interview-based study to explore clinicians’ experiences
            with AI-assisted early warning systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Purpose and contribution</h3>
          <p>
            Both papers contributed to the body of knowledge in clinical decision support. The
            quantitative paper aligned closely with my interest in machine-learning models built on
            vital-sign patterns, while the qualitative paper highlighted adoption challenges such as
            trust, alarm fatigue and workflow constraints.
          </p>

          <h3>Appropriateness of methods</h3>
          <p>
            The quantitative paper used supervised learning and appropriate evaluation metrics,
            making it suitable for a prediction-focused research question. The qualitative paper used
            semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, which was ideal for exploring human
            factors and clinician perspectives.
          </p>

          <h3>Data collection and analysis</h3>
          <p>
            The quantitative study relied on secondary datasets with high-frequency vital signs and
            followed rigorous validation steps. The qualitative study used carefully coded interview
            transcripts to generate themes. Both approaches fit the nature of their research aims.
          </p>

          <h3>Evidence and claims</h3>
          <p>
            In both papers, claims were supported with appropriate evidence — performance results
            and comparisons in the quantitative study, and representative quotations and consistent
            thematic patterns in the qualitative study.
          </p>

          <h3>Suggestions for enhancement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Add external validation for the ML model using prehospital datasets.</li>
            <li>Include explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME) to support clinical interpretability.</li>
            <li>Extend the qualitative study to include paramedics and EMS context.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This activity strengthened my understanding of how different research methods work
            together. For my own topic — predicting patient deterioration in prehospital care — a
            quantitative ML approach will be central, but qualitative insights about real-world usage
            remain valuable. This activity supports LO3 by helping me critically evaluate how existing
            studies are structured.

          </div>

          <p>
            Alongside the seminar, I completed the Research Proposal Review activity. I examined how an existing
            study structured its research problem, aims, methods, and justification, and then compared this with
            what I would need for my own proposal.
          </p>

          <h3>Key learning</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Clear alignment between research question, method choice, and evaluation approach is essential.</li>
            <li>Scope control matters: feasibility depends on data access, timeframe, and ethical approval.</li>
            <li>Strong proposals justify why the study is needed and how it contributes to the discipline.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This activity helped me understand what makes a proposal persuasive and academically sound. It also
            guided me to improve my own proposal structure, particularly in method justification and feasibility.

          <div class="card-header">
            <h2 class="page-title">Seminar 3: Case Study on Privacy</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 4 · Ethical and legal issues in data access</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            This seminar focused on a privacy case involving Ricardo, a records clerk with access to
            sensitive property tax data, and Beth, a researcher requesting identifiable information
            that she was not authorised to access. The scenario highlighted important questions about
            consent, responsible data handling and organisational policy.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical issues for Ricardo</h3>
          <p>
            If Ricardo is not responsible for determining access, he must not release any identifiable
            data. He is bound by organisational policy, confidentiality obligations and data protection
            regulations. Even if he is responsible for access decisions, he must evaluate whether the
            request adheres to lawful, ethical and professional standards.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical issues for the Records Department</h3>
          <p>
            The department must consider whether releasing names aligns with the original purpose of the
            data collection, whether Beth has ethical approval, and whether disclosure poses risks to the
            individuals. Issues of re-identification, privacy, fairness and public trust are central.
          </p>

          <h3>Should Beth contact the individuals?</h3>
          <p>
            Beth should only contact individuals if informed consent is obtained through an approved
            ethical process. Having access to anonymised data does not justify retrieving or using
            identifiable information unless the organisation explicitly authorises it and privacy
            safeguards are in place.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-response and study validity</h3>
          <p>
            If only one-third give permission, one-third deny and one-third do not respond, Beth cannot
            assume implied consent from non-responders. Her options include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Proceeding with only the consenting group.</li>
            <li>Redesigning the methodology.</li>
            <li>Using anonymised or aggregated data instead.</li>
            <li>Providing a methodological justification for the smaller sample size.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This case connects directly to my own experience in healthcare, where physiological and
            clinical data must be handled with extreme care. Ethical approval, consent and data
            minimisation are essential before using any identifiable data. The seminar reinforced the
            importance of responsible practice as outlined across ACM and BCS ethical codes.

          </div>

          <p>
            In Unit 4, I produced a formative Literature Review Outline. I organised early literature into themes
            and refined my approach to searching academic databases and selecting sources.
          </p>

          <h3>What I focused on</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Defining themes relevant to AI decision support and predictive modelling in healthcare.</li>
            <li>Improving keyword strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria for papers.</li>
            <li>Identifying gaps and limitations that could shape my research contribution.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            The outline helped me create a clearer narrative rather than a list of papers. It also reinforced
            the importance of critical evaluation (method, bias, generalisability, and context).

            <h2 class="page-title">Wiki Activity: Questionnaires</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 5 · Designing surveys responsibly</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            For the wiki activity, I selected a publicly available healthcare technology adoption questionnaire aimed at
            clinicians. At first glance, the layout appeared professional, but a closer review revealed several design
            problems that could seriously affect data quality.
          </p>

          <p>
            First, some items were double-barrelled. For example, one question asked how confident respondents were that AI
            tools would “improve patient outcomes and support daily workflow”. These are two different constructs, and
            combining them in a single question makes it impossible to know which aspect the respondent is rating. Second,
            the questionnaire used technical language such as “algorithmic transparency” and “predictive latency” without
            explanation. For busy clinicians with varying digital literacy, this increases the risk of confusion and
            unreliable responses.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ordering and grouping of questions also lacked structure. Items about usability, trust, training and perceived
            risk were mixed together without headings or logical flow. This can cause respondent fatigue and encourage
            satisficing (ticking answers quickly rather than thinking carefully).
          </p>

          <p>
            In the wiki, I suggested splitting double-barrelled items, simplifying terminology with short clarifications, and
            organising questions into themed sections with clear instructions. I also recommended including a small number of
            open-ended questions to capture concerns that fixed scales might miss. This activity reinforced how good
            questionnaire design is not just about aesthetics, but about clarity, fairness and alignment with the research
            aims.

          </div>

          <p>
            I completed the reflective activity on inappropriate use of surveys. I explored how surveys can be misused
            when they are poorly aligned to the research question, contain leading or ambiguous items, or encourage
            biased interpretations.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Surveys should not be used to “prove” a desired outcome.</li>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This activity reinforced that research tools must be chosen and designed based on fit, fairness, and
            transparency — especially in healthcare contexts where results can influence decisions and policy.

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            These activities helped me connect academic development to career direction. They also reinforced the value
            of continuous improvement, especially when working in healthcare-related environments where responsibility
            and professional standards are essential.

          <p>
            In Unit 12, I completed the self-test quiz to check my understanding of key topics across the module,
            including research design, ethical practice, and statistics for evidence-based conclusions.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            The quiz helped me identify any areas needing revision before final submission. It also reinforced how the
            module connects research quality, data interpretation, and professional responsibility.
