            <h2 class="page-title">Seminar 2: Peer Review Activity</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 3 · Evaluating literature, research design and methods</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            In this seminar, I reviewed two research papers in the broad area of AI in healthcare 
            that used different research methods. One paper applied a quantitative machine-learning 
            approach to predict patient deterioration using physiological time-series data, while the 
            second paper used a qualitative, interview-based study to explore clinicians’ experiences 
            with AI-assisted early warning systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Purpose and contribution</h3>
          <p>
            Both papers contributed to the body of knowledge in clinical decision support. The 
            quantitative paper aligned closely with my interest in machine-learning models built on 
            vital-sign patterns, while the qualitative paper highlighted adoption challenges such as 
            trust, alarm fatigue and workflow constraints.
          </p>

          <h3>Appropriateness of methods</h3>
          <p>
            The quantitative paper used supervised learning and appropriate evaluation metrics, 
            making it suitable for a prediction-focused research question. The qualitative paper used 
            semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, which was ideal for exploring human 
            factors and clinician perspectives.
          </p>

          <h3>Data collection and analysis</h3>
          <p>
            The quantitative study relied on secondary datasets with high-frequency vital signs and 
            followed rigorous validation steps. The qualitative study used carefully coded interview 
            transcripts to generate themes. Both approaches fit the nature of their research aims.
          </p>

          <h3>Evidence and claims</h3>
          <p>
            In both papers, claims were supported with appropriate evidence — performance results 
            and comparisons in the quantitative study, and representative quotations and consistent 
            thematic patterns in the qualitative study.
          </p>

          <h3>Suggestions for enhancement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Add external validation for the ML model using prehospital datasets.</li>
            <li>Include explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME) to support clinical interpretability.</li>
            <li>Extend the qualitative study to include paramedics and EMS context.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This activity strengthened my understanding of how different research methods work 
            together. For my own topic — predicting patient deterioration in prehospital care — a 
            quantitative ML approach will be central, but qualitative insights about real-world usage 
            remain valuable. This activity supports LO3 by helping me critically evaluate how existing 
            studies are structured.

        <!-- SEMINAR 3 -->
        <div class="card" id="seminar3">
          <div class="card-header">
            <h2 class="page-title">Seminar 3: Case Study on Privacy</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 4 · Ethical and legal issues in data access</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            This seminar focused on a privacy case involving Ricardo, a records clerk with access to 
            sensitive property tax data, and Beth, a researcher requesting identifiable information 
            that she was not authorised to access. The scenario highlighted important questions about 
            consent, responsible data handling and organisational policy.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical issues for Ricardo</h3>
          <p>
            If Ricardo is not responsible for determining access, he must not release any identifiable 
            data. He is bound by organisational policy, confidentiality obligations and data protection 
            regulations. Even if he is responsible for access decisions, he must evaluate whether the 
            request adheres to lawful, ethical and professional standards.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical issues for the Records Department</h3>
          <p>
            The department must consider whether releasing names aligns with the original purpose of the 
            data collection, whether Beth has ethical approval, and whether disclosure poses risks to the 
            individuals. Issues of re-identification, privacy, fairness and public trust are central.
          </p>

          <h3>Should Beth contact the individuals?</h3>
          <p>
            Beth should only contact individuals if informed consent is obtained through an approved 
            ethical process. Having access to anonymised data does not justify retrieving or using 
            identifiable information unless the organisation explicitly authorises it and privacy 
            safeguards are in place.
          </p>

          <h3>Non-response and study validity</h3>
          <p>
            If only one-third give permission, one-third deny and one-third do not respond, Beth cannot 
            assume implied consent from non-responders. Her options include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Proceeding with only the consenting group.</li>
            <li>Redesigning the methodology.</li>
            <li>Using anonymised or aggregated data instead.</li>
            <li>Providing a methodological justification for the smaller sample size.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            This case connects directly to my own experience in healthcare, where physiological and 
            clinical data must be handled with extreme care. Ethical approval, consent and data 
            minimisation are essential before using any identifiable data. The seminar reinforced the 
            importance of responsible practice as outlined across ACM and BCS ethical codes.
