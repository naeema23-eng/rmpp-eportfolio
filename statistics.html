            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 6 · Understanding quantitative methods</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 6 introduced quantitative methods as a way of examining relationships between variables that are measured
            numerically and organised into datasets. A dataset can be thought of as a table where each row represents an
            observation and each column represents a variable of interest. Before selecting any analytical method, it is
            essential to understand the <strong>level of measurement</strong> of each variable—nominal, ordinal, interval
            or ratio—as this determines which statistical techniques are valid.
          </p>

          <p>
            The focus of this unit was on <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Measures of location, such as the mean
            and median, describe a “typical” observation, while measures of spread, such as the range, variance and standard
            deviation, provide insight into the variability or stability of the data. These concepts form the foundation for
            later inferential techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            In relation to my project on predicting patient deterioration in ambulance settings, descriptive statistics are
            crucial for understanding the baseline characteristics of physiological data. For example, summarising typical
            heart rate or blood pressure values for stable vs. deteriorating patients helps identify early differences and
            potential predictive markers. Examining the spread of values also reveals patterns, outliers and inconsistencies
            that may affect model performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            This unit reinforced that effective quantitative research begins with clean data, correct understanding of
            measurement levels, and careful descriptive analysis before advancing to more complex modelling.

          <p>
            Unit 7 introduced inferential statistics as the process of making evidence-based conclusions about a population
            using a sample, while recognising uncertainty and quantifying it using probability. The main practical focus was
            applying hypothesis testing to determine whether observed differences are likely to reflect real effects rather
            than random variation.

            The worksheet calculations were completed in Excel. The results below summarise the outputs (summary measures,
            variance check where applicable, and hypothesis test p-values) and provide brief interpretation aligned to the

            <h2 class="page-title">Unit 8 – Data Analysis and Visualisation</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 8 · Charts, distributions, and ethical data presentation</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Unit 8 focused on analysing and presenting quantitative data using appropriate visualisation techniques,
            while also developing an awareness of how data presentation can influence interpretation and decision-making.
            Through a series of structured Excel exercises, I explored frequency distributions, percentage comparisons,
            and histogram construction to identify patterns within datasets and communicate findings clearly and ethically.
          </p>

          <h3>Interpretation of Frequency and Percentage Charts</h3>

          <h4>Single-area frequency and percentage analysis (Exercise 8.1D)</h4>
          <p>
            The frequency and percentage charts for categories A, B, and Other provide a clear overview of distribution
            within a single area. The charts show that the “Other” category dominates both in absolute frequency and relative
            percentage, while categories A and B represent smaller but distinct proportions of the dataset.
            Presenting both frequencies and percentages is essential, as frequencies show the raw scale of observations,
            whereas percentages allow for proportional comparison independent of sample size.
          </p>
          <p>
            This exercise highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate visual representation depending on the
            analytical goal. While frequency charts are useful for understanding volume, percentage charts are more effective
            when comparing relative importance between categories. Using both together avoids misinterpretation that could
            arise if only one representation were presented.
          </p>

          <h4>Comparative analysis across areas and locations (Exercises 8.2D and 8.2E)</h4>
          <p>
            The clustered bar charts comparing Area 1 and Area 2, and Location A and Location B, demonstrate how visualisation
            supports comparative analysis. In these charts, differences between categories become immediately apparent.
            For example, some categories show higher frequencies in one area or location compared to another, indicating
            potential contextual or environmental influences on the observed outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The percentage charts are particularly valuable in this context, as they normalise the data and allow meaningful
            comparison even when total sample sizes differ between groups. Without percentage-based visualisation, conclusions
            drawn from raw frequencies alone could be misleading. This reinforces the principle that data visualisation is not
            merely decorative, but a critical analytical tool that shapes how findings are understood.
          </p>

          <h3>Histogram Analysis and Distribution Shape (Exercise 8.3B)</h3>
          <p>
            The histogram constructed for Diet A illustrates the distribution of weight loss values across defined class intervals.
            By grouping the data into five equal-width classes and plotting relative frequency against class marks, the histogram reveals
            the overall shape of the distribution. The results indicate that most observations fall within the middle class intervals,
            with fewer values at the lower and upper extremes.
          </p>
          <p>
            This pattern suggests a concentration of outcomes around moderate weight loss values, with limited extreme responses.
            The histogram provides insights that would not be visible from summary statistics alone, such as the mean and standard deviation.
            In particular, it allows assessment of skewness, spread, and clustering, which are essential for understanding variability and
            potential outliers within the dataset.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical Considerations in Data Visualisation</h3>
          <p>
            A key theme in Unit 8 was the ethical responsibility of the analyst when presenting data. Visualisations can be manipulated,
            intentionally or unintentionally, through choices such as axis scaling, category inclusion, or selective reporting of results.
            For example, including inappropriate categories (such as totals within frequency charts) or choosing misleading scales could
            exaggerate or minimise apparent differences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The case study discussion reinforced that even when data values are correct, presenting analyses in a way that supports only a
            preferred conclusion undermines professional integrity. As a computing and data professional, it is essential to present results
            transparently, acknowledge limitations, and avoid techniques that could mislead stakeholders. Ethical data visualisation is therefore
            a fundamental component of responsible research practice.
          </p>

          <h3>Reflection (What? So What? Now What?)</h3>
          <div class="reflection-grid">
            <div class="reflection-item">
              <h4>What?</h4>
              <p>
                In this unit, I learned how to construct and interpret frequency charts, percentage charts, and histograms, and how each type of
                visualisation serves a different analytical purpose. I also developed practical skills in organising data into class intervals and
                using relative frequencies to represent distributions accurately.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-item">
              <h4>So what?</h4>
              <p>
                These skills are critical because visualisation directly influences how results are perceived and interpreted. Poorly chosen or
                misleading charts can distort understanding, while well-designed visualisations support clear, evidence-based decision-making.
                The unit also strengthened my awareness of ethical considerations in data analysis, particularly the responsibility to present
                findings honestly and contextually.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-item">
              <h4>Now what?</h4>
              <p>
                Going forward, I will apply these principles in my MSc research project by carefully selecting visualisation techniques that align
                with the nature of the data and the research questions. I will ensure that charts are used to clarify, rather than manipulate,
                findings, and that both statistical results and their limitations are communicated transparently. These skills will also be directly
                applicable in professional contexts where data-driven decisions must be justified clearly and ethically.

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              Unit 9 focused on three core dimensions of research quality: validity, reliability, and generalisability.
              These concepts are essential for judging whether conclusions are trustworthy, whether statistical findings
              can be interpreted correctly, and whether results can be applied beyond the immediate study sample.
              In practice, even technically correct analysis can become misleading if reliability is weak, validity is
              compromised by bias or confounding, or generalisability is overstated.

          </section>

          <section class="content-block">
            <h3>Validity and Reliability</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Reliability</strong> refers to consistency: if the same measurement process is repeated under the same conditions,
              it should yield similar results. Reliability concerns include measurement error, inconsistent data collection procedures,
              and analyst-dependent steps that cannot be reproduced.

            <p>
              <strong>Validity</strong> refers to accuracy of meaning: whether a measure or method truly captures the construct being studied.
              Validity can be considered across multiple forms. <strong>Internal validity</strong> concerns whether observed effects are truly
              due to the factor of interest rather than confounders. <strong>Construct validity</strong> concerns whether the chosen variables
              and operational definitions genuinely represent the theoretical concept. <strong>Inferential validity</strong> concerns whether
              statistical conclusions follow appropriately from the data and chosen tests.
            </p>
            <p>
              A key learning point is that reliability is a prerequisite for validity: a method that produces inconsistent outcomes cannot be trusted
              to measure the intended construct accurately. In addition, practices such as selective reporting or “cherry-picking” statistically
              favourable results can undermine inferential validity by presenting only part of the evidential picture.

            <h3>Generalisability</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Generalisability</strong> concerns whether findings apply beyond the sample studied. In quantitative research,
              generalisability depends on sampling strategy, sample size, representativeness, and whether the study context matches the context
              where results will be applied. Even statistically significant results may not generalise if the sample is biased or highly specific.
            </p>
            <p>
              In qualitative research, the aim is often depth rather than population inference. Therefore, transferability is achieved through
              rich contextual description and transparent reasoning rather than statistical representativeness. Across both approaches, the key
              ethical responsibility is to avoid overstating claims beyond what the study design can support.

            <h3>Connection to My MSc Project Context</h3>
            <p>
              These concepts are directly relevant to my ongoing interest in predicting patient deterioration in ambulance settings.
              If a predictive model is trained on physiological data collected under specific operational conditions, the model’s performance
              may not generalise to different regions, different ambulance crews, or different patient populations. Ensuring reliability requires
              consistent data acquisition protocols. Ensuring validity requires careful definition of deterioration outcomes, awareness of confounding
              factors (e.g., medication, comorbidities), and transparent evaluation. Ensuring generalisability requires testing across varied settings
              and reporting limitations clearly.

          <h3 class="section-label">Evidence: Power BI Learning Module Completion</h3>

          <p>
            As part of Unit 9, I completed the Microsoft Learn module
            <em>Design Power BI reports</em>, which focuses on selecting appropriate
            visualisations, designing analytical versus dashboard reports, and
            communicating data clearly and ethically. The module directly supports
            the concepts of validity, reliability, and interpretability discussed
            in this unit.
          </p>

          <p>Key learning outcomes from this activity included:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Selecting appropriate visuals for different data types and analytical goals</li>
            <li>Distinguishing between dashboard and analytical report design</li>
            <li>Using KPIs, filters, and slicers to support valid interpretation</li>
            <li>Avoiding misleading or inappropriate visual representations</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This learning is directly relevant to my MSc research project on predicting
            patient deterioration in ambulance settings. In healthcare and emergency
            contexts, poorly designed dashboards or inappropriate visualisations can
            lead to misinterpretation and unsafe decisions. The Power BI module strengthened
            my ability to design reports that communicate uncertainty, trends, and
            performance metrics clearly, supporting ethical, valid, and reliable
            data-driven decision-making.
