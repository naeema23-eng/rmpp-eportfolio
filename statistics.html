          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 6 introduced quantitative methods as a way of examining relationships between variables that are measured
            numerically and organised into datasets. A dataset can be thought of as a table where each row represents an
            observation and each column represents a variable of interest. Before selecting any analytical method, it is
            essential to understand the <strong>level of measurement</strong> of each variable—nominal, ordinal, interval
            or ratio—as this determines which statistical techniques are valid.
          </p>

          <p>
            The focus of this unit was on <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Measures of location, such as the mean
            and median, describe a “typical” observation, while measures of spread, such as the range, variance and standard
            deviation, provide insight into the variability or stability of the data. These concepts form the foundation for
            later inferential techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            In relation to my project on predicting patient deterioration in ambulance settings, descriptive statistics are
            crucial for understanding the baseline characteristics of physiological data. For example, summarising typical
            heart rate or blood pressure values for stable vs. deteriorating patients helps identify early differences and
            potential predictive markers. Examining the spread of values also reveals patterns, outliers and inconsistencies
            that may affect model performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            This unit reinforced that effective quantitative research begins with clean data, correct understanding of
            measurement levels, and careful descriptive analysis before advancing to more complex modelling.

            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 7 · Applying descriptive and inferential statistics</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 7 built directly on the descriptive statistics from Unit 6 and moved into <strong>inferential statistics</strong>.
            The focus was on understanding how we can use sample data to make statements about a wider population, quantify
            uncertainty using probability, and test claims through formal <strong>hypothesis testing</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The worksheets for this unit used several real-world datasets (B–G) covering weight-loss interventions, income
            differences, brand preferences, ecological prevalence, packaging designs and filtration agents. For each dataset,
            I calculated appropriate summary measures (for example, means and standard deviations), selected a suitable
            statistical test (independent t-test, paired t-test or chi-square), and interpreted the results in context.
          </p>

          <p>
            The activity showed how descriptive statistics and hypothesis tests work together: summary measures help to
            understand patterns in the data, while inferential methods indicate whether those patterns are likely to reflect
            genuine population differences or may be due to random variation. The interpretations below document the key
            findings for each dataset and link them back to good research practice.

        <div class="card" id="dataset-b">
          <div class="card-header">
            <h2 class="page-title">Dataset B – Diets (Summary Measures &amp; Independent t-test)</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 7 · e-Portfolio Activity 7.1 &amp; 7.2</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Context and variables</h3>
          <p>
            Dataset B contains weight-loss data for 100 individuals who followed one of two diets, A or B.
            The variables are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Diet</strong> – the diet undertaken (A or B).</li>
            <li><strong>Wtloss</strong> – weight loss in kilograms after a fixed period (negative values indicate weight gain).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Descriptive statistics</h3>
          <p>
            Each diet group contained 50 participants. The mean weight loss on Diet A was approximately
            <strong>5.341 kg</strong> (SD ≈ <strong>2.536</strong>), while the mean on Diet B was around
            <strong>3.710 kg</strong> (SD ≈ <strong>2.769</strong>). This suggests that Diet A produced greater average weight loss,
            but both groups showed noticeable variability, with some individuals even gaining weight.
          </p>

          <h3>Hypothesis test and interpretation</h3>
          <p>
            To determine whether this difference is statistically significant, I used an
            <strong>independent-samples t-test</strong> (equal variances supported by an F-test):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>H₀:</strong> There is no difference in mean weight loss between Diet A and Diet B (μ<sub>A</sub> = μ<sub>B</sub>).</li>
            <li><strong>H₁:</strong> The mean weight loss differs between the two diets (μ<sub>A</sub> ≠ μ<sub>B</sub>).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The test produced a t-statistic of approximately <strong>t = 3.072</strong> with
            <strong>98 degrees of freedom</strong> and a two-tailed <strong>p-value ≈ 0.00275</strong>. At the 5% significance level,
            this allowed me to <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong>. Statistically, there is strong evidence that the
            population mean weight loss differs between the diets, with Diet A performing better in this sample.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning points</h3>
          <p>
            This exercise showed how descriptive statistics can highlight potential differences, but hypothesis testing is
            required to judge whether those differences are likely to be real rather than random. It also reinforced key
            ideas such as setting up H₀ and H₁, using an appropriate test for independent groups, and interpreting p-values
            in the context of the research question. In my own work with physiological data, I can apply the same logic to
            compare, for example, the performance of different early-warning scores or machine-learning models.

          <div class="card-header">
            <h2 class="page-title">Dataset C – Superplus (Income by Sex)</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 7 · Independent t-test with ratio data</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Context and variables</h3>
          <p>
            Dataset C records the annual incomes of 120 cardholders of a “Superplus Diamond” card:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sex</strong> – male (M) or female (F).</li>
            <li><strong>Income</strong> – gross annual income in thousands of pounds (£000s).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Descriptive statistics</h3>
          <p>
            The sample contained 60 males and 60 females. The mean male income was about
            <strong>£52.91k</strong> (SD ≈ <strong>£15.27k</strong>), while the mean female income was roughly
            <strong>£44.23k</strong> (SD ≈ <strong>£13.79k</strong>). On average, male cardholders in this sample earn more,
            but there is substantial overlap between the two distributions, which is why inferential analysis is needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Hypothesis test and interpretation</h3>
          <p>
            I used an <strong>independent-samples t-test</strong> to compare mean incomes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>H₀:</strong> Mean income is equal for males and females (μ<sub>M</sub> = μ<sub>F</sub>).</li>
            <li><strong>H₁:</strong> Mean income differs by sex (μ<sub>M</sub> ≠ μ<sub>F</sub>).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The test gave <strong>t ≈ 3.27</strong> with <strong>118 degrees of freedom</strong> and a two-tailed
            <strong>p-value ≈ 0.0014</strong>. With p &lt; 0.05, I <strong>rejected the null hypothesis</strong>. There is strong
            statistical evidence that male and female mean incomes differ in the population, with higher average income
            for men in this dataset.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning points</h3>
          <p>
            This example emphasised that even when distributions overlap, statistically significant differences can exist
            at the population level. It also illustrated how to work with ratio-level financial data and interpret the
            results carefully, avoiding over-generalisation. For my future research with AI models, similar tests can be
            used to compare performance across subgroups (for example, different hospital sites or patient cohorts) to
            check for fairness and robustness.

            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 7 · Categorical data and Chi-square</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Context and variables</h3>
          <p>
            Dataset D comes from a marketing study that recorded which brand consumers preferred in two demographic areas.
            The variables are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Area</strong> – demographic area (1 or 2).</li>
            <li><strong>Brand</strong> – preferred brand (A, B or Other).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Descriptive summary</h3>
          <p>
            A cross-tabulation by area showed some differences in raw counts, so a Chi-square test was used to check
            whether any differences were statistically meaningful.
          </p>

          <h3>Chi-square test of independence</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>H₀:</strong> Brand preference is independent of area.</li>
            <li><strong>H₁:</strong> Brand preference is associated with area.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Using the 2×3 contingency table (Area × Brand), the Chi-square statistic was approximately
            <strong>χ² ≈ 3.29</strong> with <strong>2 degrees of freedom</strong>, giving a <strong>p-value ≈ 0.193</strong>. Because
            p &gt; 0.05, I <strong>failed to reject the null hypothesis</strong>. Statistically, there is not enough evidence to say
            that brand preference differs significantly between the two areas.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning points</h3>
          <p>
            This dataset helped me practise working with purely categorical data and reinforced when to use a Chi-square test.
            It also highlighted the difference between apparent differences in raw counts and statistically significant
            differences. In AI and healthcare, similar contingency-table approaches can be applied to outcomes such as
            “deteriorated vs. stable” across different hospitals or triage categories to test whether patterns are random or
            meaningful.

            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 7 · Frequency tables and association</div>
          </div>

          <h3>Context and variables</h3>
          <p>
            Dataset E summarises an ecological study of heather prevalence across two heathland locations.
            The data are already collated into a frequency table:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Location</strong> – A or B.</li>
            <li><strong>Prevalence</strong> – Absent, Sparse or Abundant.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frequency distribution and interpretation</h3>
          <p>
            The frequency table showed how many transects fell into each prevalence category at each location, which is a
            useful way to summarise discrete categorical outcomes before any modelling. Patterns in the table suggest that
            prevalence varies between locations, likely reflecting different habitat conditions.
          </p>

          <h3>Learning points</h3>
          <p>
            This example strengthened my ability to interpret frequency tables and think carefully about how categorical
            outcomes can be compared across groups. In healthcare and AI research, similar summaries are used for
            deterioration categories, triage levels, or model output classes before applying inferential tests or predictive
            modelling.

          </div>

          <h3>Context and variables</h3>
          <p>
            Dataset F comes from a detergent manufacturer that tested two different container designs. Each store sold the
            product in both designs and the number of items sold was recorded:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Store</strong> – store ID (1–10).</li>
            <li><strong>Con1</strong> – items sold in Container Design 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Con2</strong> – items sold in Container Design 2.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Descriptive statistics</h3>
          <p>
            Across the ten stores, the mean number of units sold was about <strong>172.6</strong> for Design 1 and
            <strong>159.4</strong> for Design 2. Because each store is measured under both conditions, the observations are
            <strong>paired</strong>, and the key quantity is the difference in sales per store (Con1 − Con2). The mean difference was
            approximately <strong>+13.2 units</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>Paired-samples t-test</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>H₀:</strong> The mean difference in sales between designs is zero.</li>
            <li><strong>H₁:</strong> The mean difference in sales is not zero.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The test gave <strong>t ≈ 2.875</strong> with <strong>9 degrees of freedom</strong> and a two-tailed
            <strong>p-value ≈ 0.0183</strong>. With p &lt; 0.05, I <strong>rejected the null hypothesis</strong>. The evidence suggests that
            sales under Design 1 and Design 2 differ significantly, with Design 1 performing better in this sample.

          <h3>Context and variables</h3>
          <p>
            Dataset G relates to the final process in the production of a chemical product. Each batch is filtered using two
            different agents, and the remaining impurities are measured:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Batch</strong> – batch ID (1–12).</li>
            <li><strong>Agent1</strong> – impurities after filtration with Agent 1 (parts per 1000).</li>
            <li><strong>Agent2</strong> – impurities after filtration with Agent 2 (parts per 1000).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Lower impurity values indicate better filtration performance.
          </p>

          <h3>Descriptive statistics</h3>
          <p>
            On average, impurity levels were approximately <strong>8.25</strong> parts per 1000 for Agent 1 and
            <strong>8.68</strong> for Agent 2. Because each batch was processed with both agents, the data are paired. The mean
            difference (Agent1 − Agent2) was about <strong>−0.433</strong>, indicating that impurity levels tended to be lower—and
            therefore better—for Agent 1.
          </p>

          <h3>Paired-samples t-test</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>H₀:</strong> There is no difference in mean impurity between Agent 1 and Agent 2.</li>
            <li><strong>H₁:</strong> There is a difference in mean impurity between the two agents.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The results gave <strong>t ≈ −3.264</strong> with <strong>11 degrees of freedom</strong> and a two-tailed
            <strong>p-value ≈ 0.00755</strong>. Since p &lt; 0.05, I <strong>rejected the null hypothesis</strong>. Statistically, there is
            strong evidence that the agents differ, and the negative mean difference suggests that <strong>Agent 1 leaves fewer
            impurities</strong> and is therefore more effective in this sample.
