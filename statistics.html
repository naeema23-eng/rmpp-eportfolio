            <h2 class="page-title">Unit 6 – Descriptive Statistics and Levels of Measurement</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Unit 6 · Understanding quantitative methods</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 6 introduced quantitative methods as a way of examining relationships between variables that are measured 
            numerically and organised into datasets. A dataset can be thought of as a table where each row represents an 
            observation and each column represents a variable of interest. Before selecting any analytical method, it is 
            essential to understand the <strong>level of measurement</strong> of each variable—nominal, ordinal, interval 
            or ratio—as this determines which statistical techniques are valid.
          </p>

          <p>
            The focus of this unit was on <strong>descriptive statistics</strong>. Measures of location, such as the mean 
            and median, describe a “typical” observation, while measures of spread, such as the range, variance and standard 
            deviation, provide insight into the variability or stability of the data. These concepts form the foundation for 
            later inferential techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            In relation to my project on predicting patient deterioration in ambulance settings, descriptive statistics are 
            crucial for understanding the baseline characteristics of physiological data. For example, summarising typical 
            heart rate or blood pressure values for stable vs. deteriorating patients helps identify early differences and 
            potential predictive markers. Examining the spread of values also reveals patterns, outliers and inconsistencies 
            that may affect model performance.
          </p>

          <p>
            This unit reinforced that effective quantitative research begins with clean data, correct understanding of 
            measurement levels, and careful descriptive analysis before advancing to more complex modelling.

            Later in the module, Units 7–10 will focus on statistical concepts that support sound research design.
            This page is ready to store the completed worksheets and a short commentary once those activities are done.

          <p>
            After I complete each worksheet, I will add a concise summary here that explains:

          <ul>
            <li>Which dataset was used</li>
            <li>Which statistical techniques were applied</li>
            <li>What the main findings were and how they relate to research methods</li>

            The Unit 9 charts example will emphasise choosing appropriate visualisations and explaining results to
            non-specialist audiences. This section is reserved for that activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Unit 9 worksheet is complete, I will use this space to describe:

          <ul>
            <li>Which chart types I used (for example, bar charts, boxplots, histograms)</li>
            <li>Why these were suitable for the variables and research question</li>
            <li>How I would explain the charts and results in clear, simple language</li>
