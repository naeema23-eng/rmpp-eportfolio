          <h3>Working Title</h3>
          <p><strong>Implementing Machine Learning in Medical Diagnosis: Early Prediction of Patient Deterioration from Prehospital Physiological Signals</strong></p>

          <h3>1. Focus and Aim of the Review</h3>
          <p>
            The aim of this literature review is to examine how machine learning models can analyse prehospital
            physiological signals—such as heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO₂, EtCO₂, ECG and blood pressure—to predict
            early patient deterioration before it becomes clinically visible. The review is intended for an academic
            audience studying AI in healthcare and for professionals interested in safe and effective prehospital
            decision-support systems.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Significance of the Topic</h3>
          <p>
            Prehospital care requires rapid decision-making under pressure. Research suggests that subtle changes in
            physiological signals can precede visible deterioration, yet these patterns are difficult to detect manually.
            Machine learning models have demonstrated strong predictive potential, but prehospital environments present
            unique challenges such as noise, motion artefacts and incomplete data. Understanding the literature is
            essential for improving ambulance triage, enhancing patient safety and supporting the ethical integration
            of AI in emergency medicine.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Context and Theoretical Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            This review takes a physiology-driven and clinical risk modelling perspective. It draws on frameworks from
            biomedical physiology, AI for health risk prediction, prehospital operational constraints, and ethical and
            professional requirements such as fairness, safety, transparency and accountability under ACM and BCS codes.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Source Selection Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            Searches will be conducted in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and emergency medicine
            journals. Keywords include: “prehospital deterioration prediction”, “ambulance vital signs”, “physiological
            signals machine learning”, “AI early warning system”, and “paramedic decision support”.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong> peer-reviewed studies, recent (last 10–12 years), ML models using physiological data, emergency/prehospital or acute-care focus.</p>
          <p><strong>Exclusion criteria:</strong> chronic disease prediction, studies without ML, research using only non-physiological data.</p>

          <h3>5. Planned Structure of the Review</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction</li>
            <li>Physiological indicators of early deterioration</li>
            <li>Machine learning approaches for clinical prediction</li>
            <li>Evidence from prehospital and emergency care</li>
            <li>Operational and ethical challenges</li>
            <li>Strengths, gaps and limitations of the literature</li>
            <li>Conclusion and suggested research direction</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Main Findings (Preliminary Themes)</h3>

          <p><strong>Theme 1: Physiological Signals as Early Deterioration Predictors</strong><br>
            Vital signs such as HR variability, SpO₂ patterns, shock index, EtCO₂ and ECG abnormalities show measurable
            changes before clinical decline, supporting a physiology-centred approach.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Theme 2: ML Outperforms Manual Assessment in Early Prediction</strong><br>
            Studies show ML models can forecast cardiac arrest, respiratory failure and haemodynamic collapse earlier
            than traditional scoring systems or clinician assessment.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Theme 3: Ambulance Data Are Noisy but Usable</strong><br>
            Motion artefacts, missing data and short monitoring windows are common, but ML remains effective with proper
            preprocessing and feature engineering.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Theme 4: Ethical and Professional Considerations</strong><br>
            Bias, fairness, false alarms, transparency and data governance are central concerns. Integration must align
            with ACM/BCS expectations around competence, public safety and privacy.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Strengths and Limitations of Existing Literature</h3>
          <p>
            Strengths include strong evidence for key biomarkers and promising ML performance. Limitations include a
            shortage of prehospital-specific datasets, limited multi-parameter models, insufficient attention to ethical
            deployment and lack of external validation.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Discrepancies in the Literature</h3>
          <p>
            Studies disagree on which physiological signals are most predictive (e.g., SpO₂ reliability in motion-heavy
            environments). Some show scoring systems outperforming ML baselines while others show the opposite, revealing
            inconsistencies in model evaluation.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Conclusion and Research Direction</h3>
          <p>
            The literature indicates strong potential for ML-driven deterioration prediction using physiological signals,
            but highlights significant gaps: insufficient prehospital datasets, lack of ethical integration, and limited
            research on paramedic-AI interaction. Future research should develop physiologically informed and ethically
            governed early warning systems for ambulance environments.
