            <div class="meta small-muted">Evaluating research purpose, design and methods</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 3 introduced research methodology and highlighted how methodological choices are shaped by
            underlying assumptions about knowledge, reality and values. During the seminar peer review activity,
            I critically evaluated existing research papers to assess how well their research questions aligned
            with their chosen methods and data collection strategies.
          </p>

          <p>
            This activity helped me recognise that strong research is not defined solely by the complexity of the
            method used, but by the clarity with which the research purpose, design, data and analysis are connected.
            It influenced my own project planning by encouraging earlier consideration of feasibility, validity,
            and ethical responsibility.

          </div>

          <h3>Chosen area of interest</h3>
          <p>
            My chosen area of interest is the use of machine learning to
            <strong>predict patient deterioration in prehospital emergency care</strong>,
            based on physiological signals such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure,
            SpO₂, EtCO₂ and ECG recorded during ambulance transport.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Methods that suit my purpose</h3>
          <p>
            From this week’s readings, the method that best suits my purpose is a
            <strong>quantitative, data-driven research design</strong>,
            supported by <strong>computational modelling</strong> and a
            <strong>structured literature review</strong>.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Quantitative research is appropriate due to numerical physiological variables and measurable outcomes.</li>
            <li>Computational modelling supports pattern discovery in time-series vital signs.</li>
            <li>A literature-based approach guides justified methodological choices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Data collection methods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Secondary clinical datasets from open repositories.</li>
            <li>Public physiological signal databases.</li>
            <li>Document and literature analysis of prior research.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Skills to develop</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Machine learning and time-series analysis.</li>
            <li>Research design and statistical reasoning.</li>
            <li>Ethical and professional responsibility.</li>
          </ul>

          </div>

          <p>
            This unit focused on identifying, evaluating and synthesising academic literature related to
            early detection of patient deterioration using physiological signals and machine learning.

          <p>
            Unit 5 explored data collection strategies and reinforced the importance of feasibility,
            ethical compliance and data quality in healthcare research.

            <h2>Research Proposal Outline (Unit 8)</h2>
          </div>

          <p>
            By Unit 8, the research proposal had a clearly defined structure which later evolved into
            the full research proposal presented in Unit 10.
          </p>

        <!-- ===================== UNIT 10 ===================== -->

        <div class="card" id="unit10-writing">
          <div class="card-header">
            <h2 class="page-title">Unit 10 – Research Writing</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Research proposal presentation and feedback reflection</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 10 focused on research writing and the structure of large academic artefacts such as
            research proposals and dissertations. A key learning outcome was understanding that effective
            research writing is not simply descriptive, but involves constructing a coherent argument
            that integrates the research problem, literature, methodology, ethical considerations and
            evaluation strategy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Producing the research proposal presentation and transcript required me to apply these principles
            in practice. I had to translate complex clinical and machine-learning concepts into a clear,
            logically structured narrative suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feedback on the proposal confirmed strengths in clarity, structure and critical reasoning,
            particularly in identifying limitations of static early warning scores in dynamic ambulance
            environments. It also highlighted areas for improvement, including greater emphasis on human
            factors (such as paramedic response to AI alerts) and clearer visual explanation of the
            data-analysis pipeline.
          </p>

          <p>
            This learning will directly inform my future dissertation writing, where careful argumentation,
            transparency of limitations and ethical framing will be essential.
