          <h3>Chosen area of interest</h3>
          <p>
            My chosen area of interest is the use of machine learning to <strong>predict patient deterioration
            in prehospital emergency care</strong>, based on physiological signals such as heart rate, respiratory
            rate, blood pressure, SpO₂, EtCO₂ and ECG recorded during ambulance transport.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Methods that suit my purpose</h3>
          <p>
            From this week’s readings, the method that best suits my purpose is a <strong>quantitative,
            data-driven research design</strong>, supported by <strong>computational modelling</strong> and a
            <strong>structured literature review</strong>.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is appropriate because my project focuses on numerical
              physiological variables and measurable outcomes (e.g. deterioration vs. no deterioration).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Computational modelling</strong> (supervised machine learning) is suitable for
              discovering patterns in time-series vital signs and building predictive models.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>literature-based method</strong> will guide the choice of variables, algorithms and
              evaluation strategies, and help identify gaps in existing work.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Together, these methods align with the module’s emphasis on selecting research approaches that
            match the aims, data type and practical constraints of a project.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Data collection methods I would consider</h3>
          <p>
            Because collecting primary prehospital physiological data would require complex approvals and is
            beyond the scope of this module, I would focus on <strong>secondary data</strong> and existing
            sources:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Secondary clinical datasets</strong> from open repositories (e.g. ICU or early warning
              system datasets that contain high-frequency vital signs and labelled outcomes).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Public physiological signal databases</strong> that provide ECG, SpO₂ and other signals
              suitable for modelling deterioration or instability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Document and literature analysis</strong> of previous studies on early warning scores,
              triage tools and AI-based risk prediction.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In a future, larger-scale project it might be possible to combine these with <strong>qualitative
            methods</strong> (for example, interviews with paramedics about how they would use AI outputs), but
            for this module the emphasis will remain on secondary quantitative data and published research.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Skills I need to have or develop</h3>
          <p>
            This project builds on my existing strengths as a biomedical engineer working with emergency
            medical equipment and as an MSc Artificial Intelligence student, but it also requires deliberate
            skill development in three areas:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical and analytical skills</strong> – applying supervised machine learning to
              time-series data; handling missing and noisy physiological signals; evaluating models using
              appropriate metrics (e.g. AUROC, sensitivity, specificity).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Research design and statistics</strong> – understanding sampling, bias, validity and
              reliability; interpreting statistical outputs; linking analysis decisions to research questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ethical and professional skills</strong> – understanding data protection, consent and
              confidentiality in healthcare; aligning any proposed AI use with ACM and BCS codes of conduct and
              with regulations such as GDPR.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I will also continue to strengthen my <strong>academic writing and literature-review skills</strong>,
            so I can clearly justify my choice of methods and data collection in the final project proposal for
            Unit 10.
          </p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, a quantitative, secondary-data-based study supported by computational modelling and a
            strong literature review is both realistic for this module and well aligned with my long-term goal
            of working on AI for safe, physiology-based deterioration prediction in emergency care.

          <h3>Working title</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Implementing Machine Learning in Medical Diagnosis: Early Prediction of Patient
            Deterioration from Prehospital Physiological Signals</strong>
          </p>

          <h3>1. Focus and aim</h3>
          <p>
            The review will focus on how machine learning models can use prehospital or early-encounter
            physiological signals (vital signs and waveforms) to predict patient deterioration before it becomes
            clinically obvious. The aim is to identify which signals, models and evaluation strategies are most
            effective and what gaps remain, especially in ambulance and emergency settings.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Significance</h3>
          <p>
            Early recognition of deterioration is critical for safe triage and resource allocation. Subtle changes
            in physiological patterns are hard for humans to detect in busy environments, but may be detected by
            algorithms. Understanding the existing evidence is important for designing responsible, clinically
            meaningful AI tools in prehospital care.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Context and perspective</h3>
          <p>
            The review is framed through a physiology-driven and clinical risk-modelling perspective, while also
            incorporating ethical and professional considerations. It draws on my own experience with emergency
            medical equipment and on broader debates about AI in healthcare.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Source selection</h3>
          <p>
            Searches will be conducted in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar using terms such
            as “prehospital deterioration prediction”, “ambulance vital signs machine learning”, “early warning
            score AI” and “clinical risk prediction”.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong> peer-reviewed studies published roughly within the last 10–12
            years, using ML or statistical models on physiological data to predict deterioration, particularly in
            emergency, ICU or prehospital contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Exclusion criteria:</strong> purely chronic disease prediction, non-ML descriptive studies,
            and work based only on administrative or textual data without physiological signals.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Planned structure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Introduction and scope of the review</li>
            <li>Physiological indicators of early deterioration</li>
            <li>Machine learning and risk-modelling approaches</li>
            <li>Evidence from emergency and prehospital settings</li>
            <li>Operational, ethical and professional challenges</li>
            <li>Strengths, limitations and gaps in the literature</li>
            <li>Conclusion and suggested research direction</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>6. Preliminary themes</h3>
          <p><strong>Physiological signals:</strong> HR variability, SpO₂ trends, shock indices, EtCO₂ and ECG patterns are repeatedly highlighted as sensitive indicators of instability.</p>
          <p><strong>Model performance:</strong> Many ML models outperform traditional scoring systems for early detection of deterioration, especially when using multi-parameter data.</p>
          <p><strong>Data quality and context:</strong> Ambulance and emergency environments introduce noise, missing values and short monitoring windows, but careful preprocessing and robust models can still achieve useful performance.</p>
          <p><strong>Ethics and governance:</strong> Bias, transparency, alarm fatigue and accountability are recurring concerns in clinical AI deployment.</p>

          <h3>7. Strengths and limitations of existing work</h3>
          <p>
            Strengths include growing evidence that ML can detect deterioration earlier than manual assessment and
            strong physiological justification for the chosen variables. Limitations include limited prehospital
            datasets, a lack of external validation across settings and relatively little discussion of professional
            responsibilities and governance.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Discrepancies</h3>
          <p>
            The literature does not fully agree on which vital-sign combinations are most predictive, or on how
            much better ML is than traditional scores. There are also discrepancies in how outcomes are defined
            (e.g. cardiac arrest, ICU admission, unplanned readmission).
          </p>

          <h3>9. Conclusion and direction</h3>
          <p>
            The review will argue that ML has strong potential to support earlier detection of deterioration from
            physiological signals, but that future research should focus more on prehospital datasets, external
            validation and ethical integration into paramedic workflows.
