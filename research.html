          <p>
            My research interests sit at the intersection of <strong>artificial intelligence, healthcare and human
            physiology</strong>. The literature review activities in this module help me move from a broad curiosity
            about AI in healthcare to a focused, researchable topic that can support my long-term professional goals.
          </p>

          <p class="section-label">Early outline (Unit 2)</p>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the module, my thinking is deliberately wide. I am exploring themes such as AI for
            clinical decision support, digital health records, triage systems in ambulance services, and the ethical
            risks of using sensitive physiological data. The early outline, when completed, will record how I mapped
            potential directions, identified key keywords and noted a small group of foundational papers.
          </p>

          <p class="section-label">Refined outline (Unit 4)</p>
          <p>
            As the teaching moves towards Unit 4, the outline will become more precise. I expect to narrow towards a
            specific question, for example focusing on risk prediction, patient deterioration or responsible use of
            AI-generated recommendations in emergency care. Once the Unit 4 activity is finished, I will add the
            refined outline here, showing the shift from broad interest to clear research questions and objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until those units are complete, this section provides a structured place ready to hold my Unit 2 and Unit 4
            literature review submissions.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            In Unit 3, I will participate in a formal peer-review exercise, reading a classmate’s draft proposal and
            offering feedback on clarity, feasibility, methodology and ethics. Once the activity is completed, this
            section will summarise:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The main strengths I identified in the proposal</li>
            <li>Constructive suggestions I made to improve research design or ethics</li>
            <li>What I learned about my own proposal by reviewing someone else’s work</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For now, this card simply marks the location where the Unit 3 proposal review evidence will be added later
            in the module.

          <p>
            The Unit 4 literature review outline will provide the detailed structure for my reading: sections, themes,
            and key authors. When it is complete and submitted, I will copy the agreed outline into this section,
            highlighting how it supports the later research proposal.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the current stage of the module, the final outline has not yet been written. This section is therefore
            reserved to hold that confirmed structure once it is available.

          <p>
            By Unit 8, I will have developed a consolidated research proposal including a working title, research
            questions, objectives, methodology and ethical considerations. This section is prepared to hold that final
            outline once I reach Unit 8.

            The finished content here will show how my ideas evolved from early literature mapping into a coherent,
            methodologically sound proposal that aligns with my professional interests in AI-enabled healthcare and
            emergency services.
