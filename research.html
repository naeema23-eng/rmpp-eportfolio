          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 3 introduced research methodology and highlighted how methodological choices are shaped by
            ontological, epistemological and axiological assumptions. During the seminar peer review activity,
            I evaluated published research papers to assess how well their research questions aligned with
            their chosen methods, data collection strategies and analysis techniques.
          </p>

          <p>
            This activity reinforced that strong research is defined by coherence rather than complexity.
            I became more aware of how feasibility, bias, validity and ethical responsibility must be
            considered early in the research design process. These insights directly influenced how I
            structured and justified my own project methodology.

          <h3>Chosen area of interest</h3>
          <p>
            My chosen area of interest is the use of machine learning to
            <strong>predict patient deterioration in prehospital emergency care</strong>,
            using physiological signals such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure,
            SpO₂, EtCO₂ and ECG recorded during ambulance transport.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Methods that suit my purpose</h3>
          <p>
            A <strong>quantitative, data-driven research design</strong> supported by
            <strong>computational modelling</strong> and a
            <strong>structured literature review</strong> is most suitable for this project.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Quantitative research enables analysis of numerical physiological data.</li>
            <li>Supervised machine learning supports discovery of temporal deterioration patterns.</li>
            <li>Literature-based justification guides model and evaluation choices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Data collection methods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Secondary clinical datasets from open repositories.</li>
            <li>Public physiological signal databases.</li>
            <li>Published studies on early warning scores and ML-based risk prediction.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Skills to develop</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Time-series machine learning and noise handling.</li>
            <li>Statistical reasoning and research design.</li>
            <li>Ethical and professional responsibility in healthcare AI.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            This activity provided the methodological foundation for later units, including the
            Literature Review (Unit 7) and the Research Proposal (Unit 10).

            <h2 class="page-title">Unit 4 – Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h2>
            <div class="meta small-muted">Qualitative data collection methods</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 4 introduced qualitative data collection methods, including case studies, focus groups and
            observation. The key learning was understanding how these methods are used to explore complex
            phenomena and the limitations they introduce in terms of bias, representativeness and
            generalisability.
          </p>

          <p>
            For my project, these methods are not suitable as primary data collection tools, as my research
            focuses on numerical physiological time-series data and measurable deterioration outcomes.
            However, this unit helped me recognise how qualitative approaches could complement quantitative
            models in future work.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, focus groups or observational studies involving paramedics could help explore how
            AI-generated alerts are interpreted in practice, and how factors such as workload, trust and
            alarm fatigue affect real-world use.
          </p>

          <p>
            This critical evaluation strengthened my ability to justify the exclusion of certain methods
            while acknowledging their value for ethical and professional insight.

            <div class="meta small-muted">Data collection ethics and instrument design</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 5 focused on interviews, surveys and questionnaire design, highlighting the importance of
            question structure, sampling, response bias and ethical responsibility. The unit also introduced
            pre- and post-testing to evaluate change over time.
          </p>

          <p>
            For my project, interviews and surveys are not the primary data source, as the investigation
            centres on physiological measurements rather than self-reported data. However, this unit was
            critical in developing my awareness of ethical risks associated with data collection.
          </p>

          <p>
            Case studies such as Cambridge Analytica demonstrated how surveys can be misused, reinforcing
            the importance of consent, transparency and governance. This informed how I approached data
            reuse and ethical framing in my proposal.
          </p>

          <p>
            In future research, structured questionnaires could be used to assess clinician trust and
            usability of AI-supported decision tools, complementing quantitative performance metrics.

            <div class="meta small-muted">Interpreting and presenting results</div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 8 shifted focus from data collection to data analysis and visualisation. The unit explored
            differences between qualitative and quantitative analysis, including coding, statistical
            interpretation and the role of visualisation in communicating findings.
          </p>

          <p>
            This unit reinforced that analysis does not end with generating results. Poorly designed charts
            or selective visual emphasis can distort meaning and mislead interpretation. These lessons were
            particularly relevant when considering performance metrics for machine-learning models.
          </p>

          <p>
            The proposal outline developed during this unit provided a structured foundation for the full
            Research Proposal Presentation completed in Unit 10, especially in how results, limitations and
            evaluation metrics were explained clearly and responsibly.
          </p>

          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 10 focused on research writing and the structure of large academic artefacts such as research
            proposals and dissertations. A key learning outcome was understanding that effective research
            writing involves constructing a coherent argument that integrates the research problem, literature,
            methodology, ethics and evaluation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Producing the research proposal presentation and transcript required me to translate complex
            clinical and machine-learning concepts into a clear, logically structured narrative suitable for
            both technical and non-technical audiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            Feedback confirmed strengths in clarity, structure and critical reasoning, particularly in
            identifying the limitations of static early warning scores in dynamic ambulance environments.
            It also highlighted areas for improvement, including greater emphasis on human factors and
            clearer visual explanation of the data-analysis pipeline.
          </p>

          <p>
            This learning will directly inform my future dissertation writing, where transparency, ethical
            framing and careful interpretation will be essential.
