              Evaluating research purpose, methodology and evidence
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 3 introduced research methodology and the importance of aligning research questions with appropriate
            research design and methods. During the seminar peer review activity, I critically examined how existing
            research papers justify their methodological choices and support their conclusions with evidence.
          </p>

          <p>
            A key learning from this activity was recognising that strong research is not defined solely by technical
            complexity, but by the clarity with which purpose, method, data collection and analysis are connected.
            This influenced how I approached my own project planning, encouraging early consideration of feasibility,
            validity, and ethical responsibility.
          </p>

          <p class="small-muted">
            The impact of this learning is reflected in the e-Portfolio activity below, where I justify my selected
            research methods, data collection approach, and required skills for my proposed project.

          <h3>Chosen area of interest</h3>
          <p>
            My chosen area of interest is the use of machine learning to
            <strong>predict patient deterioration in prehospital emergency care</strong>,
            based on physiological signals such as heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure,
            SpO₂, EtCO₂ and ECG recorded during ambulance transport.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Methods that suit my purpose</h3>
          <p>
            From this week’s readings, the method that best suits my purpose is a
            <strong>quantitative, data-driven research design</strong>,
            supported by <strong>computational modelling</strong> and a
            <strong>structured literature review</strong>.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Quantitative research</strong> is appropriate because the project focuses on numerical
              physiological variables and measurable outcomes (e.g. deterioration vs. no deterioration).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Computational modelling</strong> (supervised machine learning) is suitable for discovering
              temporal patterns in time-series vital signs.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <strong>literature-based approach</strong> supports justified variable selection, model choice,
              and evaluation strategy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Together, these methods align with the module’s emphasis on selecting research approaches that match
            the aims, data type and practical constraints of a project.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Data collection methods I would consider</h3>
          <p>
            Because collecting primary prehospital physiological data would require complex approvals and is
            beyond the scope of this module, I would focus on <strong>secondary data</strong>:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Secondary clinical datasets from open repositories containing high-frequency vital signs and
              labelled outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Public physiological signal databases suitable for modelling deterioration or instability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Literature-based analysis of early warning scores and AI-based risk prediction studies.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In a future project, qualitative methods (e.g. interviews with paramedics) could complement quantitative
            analysis, but this module focuses on secondary quantitative data and published research.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Skills I need to have or develop</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Technical and analytical skills:</strong> supervised ML for time-series data, noise handling,
              and model evaluation using appropriate metrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Research design and statistics:</strong> understanding bias, validity, reliability, and
              linking analysis decisions to research questions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ethical and professional skills:</strong> data protection, responsible AI use, and alignment
              with professional codes such as GDPR and BCS.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I will also continue developing my <strong>academic writing</strong> to justify research decisions
            clearly in later units.
          </p>

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, a quantitative, secondary-data-based study supported by computational modelling and a strong
            literature review is realistic for this module and aligned with my long-term goal of developing safe,
            clinically meaningful AI tools for emergency care.

              Implementing Machine Learning in Medical Diagnosis: Early Prediction of Patient
              Deterioration from Prehospital Physiological Signals
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            This literature review focuses on how machine learning models use physiological signals to predict
            early deterioration, with emphasis on emergency and prehospital contexts.

          </div>

          <p>
            This unit explored data collection strategies and reinforced the importance of feasibility and ethics.
            A mixed-methods approach may be appropriate in future work, but this module focuses on secondary
            quantitative data and literature-based analysis.

          <p>
            By Unit 8, the proposal structure was clearly defined. This outline later evolved into the
            full research proposal presented in Unit 10.

              Research proposal presentation and feedback reflection
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Unit 10 focused on research writing and the structure of large academic artefacts such as dissertations.
            The main learning outcome was understanding how literature, methodology, ethics and evaluation must
            form a single coherent argument.
          </p>

          <p>
            Producing the research proposal presentation and transcript strengthened my ability to communicate
            complex technical ideas clearly and critically, while feedback helped identify areas for further
            improvement, particularly around human factors and visual explanation.
