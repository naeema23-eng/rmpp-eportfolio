## 1. Overview

This e-Portfolio presents a complete, structured, and evidence-based record of my learning and assessment work for the *Research Methods and Professional Practice* module.

The portfolio demonstrates my engagement with:

- Ethical and professional responsibilities in computing  
- Research design and methodology  
- Literature review development  
- Quantitative and statistical analysis  
- Collaborative academic discussion  
- Professional development and reflective practice  

All required unit activities (Units 1–12) are represented through written artefacts, reflections, analyses, and supporting evidence, organised across interlinked HTML pages. The portfolio is designed to be clear, navigable, and suitable for academic assessment.

## 3. Canonical (Primary) Assessment Pages

The following pages constitute the **primary assessment evidence** and are sufficient to evaluate all module learning outcomes:

| File | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| `index.html` | Entry point, orientation, and module overview |
| `discussion.html` | Collaborative Discussions 1 & 2 (initial posts, peer responses, summaries) |
| `research.html` | Research topic development, proposal planning, and unit-based research reflections |
| `statistics.html` | Statistics activities, worksheets, charts, interpretation, and Power BI evidence (Units 6–9) |
| `reflections.html` | Reflective Activities, Unit 11 reflection, and Unit 12 final reflection placeholder |
| `activities.html` | Full unit-by-unit activity log (Units 1–12) |
| `about.html` | Student background, learning outcomes mapping, and submission context |

➡️ These pages are directly accessible via the main navigation and represent the **core submission**.

## 4. Supplementary (Supporting) Evidence Pages

The following pages are included as **supporting evidence only**.  
They enhance clarity and presentation but **do not replace** any required assessment content.

| File | Purpose |
|-----|--------|
| `proposal-eval.html` | Focused evaluation of Literature Review and Research Proposal (300–400 words) |
| `reflective-activity-1.html` | Standalone formatted version of Reflective Activity 1 |
| `stats.html` | Supplementary statistics artefacts and additional evidence (Units 8–9) |

These pages are referenced contextually and support examiner verification.
