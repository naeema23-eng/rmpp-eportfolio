## 1. Overview

This e-Portfolio presents a complete, structured, and evidence-based record of my learning and assessment work for the *Research Methods and Professional Practice* module.

The portfolio demonstrates my engagement with:

- Ethical and professional responsibilities in computing  
- Research design and methodology  
- Literature review development  
- Quantitative and statistical analysis  
- Collaborative academic discussion  
- Professional development and reflective practice  

All required unit activities (**Units 1–12**) are represented through written artefacts, reflections, analyses, and supporting evidence, organised across interlinked HTML pages. The portfolio is designed to be clear, navigable, and suitable for academic assessment.
